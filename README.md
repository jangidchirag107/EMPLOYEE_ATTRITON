📌 Project Overview

Employee attrition is a major challenge for organizations, leading to increased recruitment costs, loss of skilled employees, and reduced productivity.

This project presents a complete end-to-end data science workflow to:

Understand employee behavior

Identify factors contributing to attrition

Predict whether an employee is likely to leave

The analysis combines data understanding, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, preprocessing, and multiple machine learning models to generate actionable HR insights.

❓ Problem Statement

Organizations often lack:

Early identification of employees at risk of leaving

Clear understanding of factors driving attrition

Predictive tools for proactive retention

🔍 Goal:

To build a machine learning–based predictive system that can:

Analyze employee data

Predict attrition probability

Support data-driven HR decision-making

🎯 Project Objectives

Perform in-depth analysis of HR employee data

Explore patterns and trends affecting attrition

Visualize key insights using charts and plots

Apply proper data preprocessing techniques

Train and compare multiple ML models

Deliver business-oriented insights and recommendations

📂 Dataset Information

Dataset: HR Employee Attrition Dataset

Target Variable: Attrition (Yes / No)

Feature Types:

👤 Demographics (Age, Gender, Education)

💼 Job Details (Department, JobRole, YearsAtCompany)

💰 Compensation (MonthlyIncome)

⚖️ Work-Life Balance & Satisfaction

⏱️ Overtime & Performance Indicators

🔍 Data Understanding & EDA

The exploratory data analysis includes:

Dataset structure and summary statistics

Target variable distribution (class imbalance)

Univariate analysis of numerical features

Categorical feature distribution

Attrition vs feature relationship analysis

📌 Key Observations:

Attrition is higher among younger employees

Employees working overtime show significantly higher attrition

Lower income groups are more prone to leave

Job satisfaction strongly impacts retention

📊 Visualization

Visualizations were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn, including:

Bar charts & count plots

Box plots for salary and experience

Attrition comparison plots

Correlation heatmap

These plots helped uncover hidden trends and relationships in the data.

⚙️ Data Preprocessing

Checked for missing values and duplicates

Converted target variable into numerical format

Separated features into:

Numerical → StandardScaler

Categorical → OneHotEncoder

Used Pipeline and ColumnTransformer to ensure:

Clean workflow

No data leakage

Reproducibility

🤖 Machine Learning Models

The following models were implemented and compared:

📌 Logistic Regression (Baseline & interpretable)

📌 Naive Bayes

📌 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

📌 Random Forest Classifier

📌 Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

📈 Model Evaluation

Models were evaluated using:

Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix

Precision, Recall & F1-Score

ROC Curve & AUC

🏆 Best Performing Models:

Random Forest

Artificial Neural Network

🧠 Key Insights

Overtime is the strongest indicator of attrition

Monthly income significantly influences employee retention

Employees with low job satisfaction are more likely to leave

Early-career employees show higher attrition risk

💼 Business Recommendations

Reduce excessive overtime policies

Improve compensation for lower-income employees

Focus retention strategies on new joiners

Enhance job satisfaction and work-life balance initiatives

🚀 Tools & Technologies
